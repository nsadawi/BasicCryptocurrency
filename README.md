# ToyCryptoCoin

Hello every one
- Here I show how to implement a simple blockchain and cryptocurrency using Python.
- The implementation goes through stages. In the beginning we create a very simple blockchain, then in part 2 we add add `proof of work` and in part 3 we add `mining rewards and transactions`. In part 4 we add `signing of transactions` to make our currency more secure.
- This is part 1 of my lecture (here we create a basic blockchain): https://www.facebook.com/noureddin.sadawi/videos/824493898640118/
- This is part 2 (where we extend the blockchain and make it a toy cryptocurrency): https://www.facebook.com/noureddin.sadawi/videos/1258962571365501 
- My implementation is based on this nice tutorial (which uses javascript):
